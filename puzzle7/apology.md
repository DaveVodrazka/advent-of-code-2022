# Apology

I have created this repo to learn Rust by solving Advent of Code problems. After several hours of trying to build a simple tree with Rust, I gave up and did it in JavaScript.

I know how to solve the problem #7, but I just cannot make it work in Rust. I made a big mental note to learn how to build linked list in Rust and hopefully will add Rust solution eventually, but for now, enjoy some good ol' TypeScript.
